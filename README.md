# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-and-Control-brightness-of-the-screen-using-Opencv-and-python
Hand gestures are an effective way of communication for
everyone. Hand gesture recognition is one of the system that can detect the
gesture of hand. In this study, The first step towards this gesture recognition is
hand capturing and analyzing designing of the hand gesture recognition is one
of the complicated job that involves some major problems. Firstly is the
detection of hand. Then,challenge for this system are constant background,
sometimes person and lighting also. This project concentrates on how a system
could detect, recognize and interpret the hand gesture recognition. It will detects
the fingers of hand and it will recognise the finger tips of thumb finger and
index finger. As the distance between two fingers increases the brightness of
screen increased according to distance between two fingers. As the distance
between two fingers decreases the brightness of screen decreased according to
distance between two fingers and vice-versa. The method of searching
connecting regions in the picture with particular specification, where a pattern
and algorithm is adjustable is known as segmentation. We are going to perform
this operation using Opencv python source code.
